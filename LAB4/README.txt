EECE 5554 LAB 4

Thanks for your reading my lab4 report!
The data recording of this lab experiment was completed by my teammates, so the driver file should be uploaded by my teammates

You can use Matlab to draw the figure, there is only one file,
But I write 2 part to analysis 2 different bag file(ruggles.bag and backbay_tour.bag) which record by my teammate. You can run it separately through breakpoints or by adding comments to generate the plot I used in report.

Thanks for your reading!
